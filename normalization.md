Tentative title: Robust normalization of flow cytometry data (15 - 25 total)
========================================

### Abstract (0.5)

### Introduction (1-2)
Set the scene and problem statement. Introduce structure of thesis, state contributions

* State the problem being solved - a narrow focused statement is better than a more ambitious and vague one
* Structure of thesis - short description of each section
* State contributions - what in this thesis is your own personal contribution?

### Background and related work (3-5)
Demonstrate wider appreciation (context). Provide motivation. The problem statement and the motivation state how you want the PhD to be judged - as engineering, scientific method, theory, philosophy, &c.

* Background to problem
	* What is flow cytometry and why is it important?
* What is the *specific* problem in flow cytometry you are trying to solve?
* Why is it important (How will the world be a better place if the problem is solved)?
* Related work
	* Survey of normalization methods in statistics
		* Try to find broad categories of principles rather than an exhaustive list
		* If appropriate, comment on relevance to flow cytometry
	* Survey of normalization methods in flow cytometry
	    * Critical assessment of each method
		* Comment on relation to own work

### Analysis, design, implementation and interpretation of results (10-15)

* Summary of your new method(s)
* Description of statistical model
* Implementation details
* Results - testing on simulated data
	* Interpretation of results
* Results - testing on real data
	* Interpretation of results

### Critical assessment of own work (1-2)
State hypothesis, and demonstrate precision, thoroughness, contribution, and comparison with closest rival.

* Restate what problem your new method solves
* Summarize advantages of your new method
* Summarize limitations of your new method
* Compare with existing methods for flow cytometry normalization

### Further Work (0.5-1)

* Are there any research ideas that you did not have time to explore further? Put them here.

### Summary & Conclusions (0.5-1)
Restate contribution. How have you made the world a better place?

### Appendix

This can be as long as you like - for example, automation scripts, code samples, details of data sets used for evaluating method, supplementary tables and figures etc can be put here. If you have a manuscript draft, under review or already accepted for publication, it can go into the appendix too.
