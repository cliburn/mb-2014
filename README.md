Note on text
----------------------------------------

I write most of my initial drafts using [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) because it provides a simple way to generate nicely formatted documents including code and math without the verbosity of LaTeX.  Mostly, I use [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) to view the results, but this is a Mac-only program. There are however, a ton of different Markdown editors that you can Google for, including free online editors such as [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) and [Dillinger](https://stackedit.io/).
